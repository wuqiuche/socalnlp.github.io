                    <b>Title:</b> Bringing Additional Symbolic Knowledge for Knowledge Graph Reasoning<br/><br/>
                    <b>Abstract:</b> Knowledge graph has received tremendous attention recently, due to its wide applications, such as search engines and Q&A systems. Knowledge graph embedding, which aims at representing entities as low-dimensional vectors, and relations as operators on these vectors, has been widely studied and successfully applied to many tasks, such as knowledge completion. However, most of the existing knowledge graph embedding approaches treat knowledge graph as a complete, error-free, and flat data structure to store knowledge. In this talk, I will introduce two recent techniques developed in our lab to bring additional knowledge for better knowledge graph embedding. First, external knowledge represented as first-order logic is brought into knowledge graph embedding, which is able to address the uncertainty in knowledge graph and handle missing facts. Second, a unified embedding framework that incorporates ontological view KG into widely studied instance view KG will be introduced, which can seamlessly bring instance world and concept world together. Both techniques can significantly enhance the quality of KG embedding, on different downstream tasks, which also show a promising future direction in better knowledge graph reasoning.<br/><br/>

                    <h5>Matt Gardner</h5>
                    <b>Title:</b> Contrastive evaluation and learning in NLP<br/><br/>
                    <b>Abstract:</b> Any dataset created by humans will almost unavoidably have spurious correlations between inputs and outputs.  This means that when we collect data and split it into train and test sets, models that maximize the likelihood of the data will tend to find these spurious correlations, and they will use them to perform better than they should at test time.  I will show that this problem is pervasive in natural language processing, extending even to traditional NLP tasks such as dependency parsing, and I will briefly demonstrate one method to partially solve this problem in our evaluations, by generalizing the long-standing notion of a "minimal pair".  Solving the problem during training is more challenging.  As a start, I will present work that leverages consistency on related examples during training to improve compositional reasoning in neural module networks.  This is admittedly a very narrow solution to the problem, but it hints at how we might approach a more general solution.<br/><br/>
                    <b>Bio:</b> Matt is a senior research scientist at the Allen Institute for AI on the AllenNLP team. His research focuses primarily on getting computers to read and answer questions, dealing both with open domain reading comprehension and with understanding question semantics in terms of some formal grounding (semantic parsing). He is particularly interested in cases where these two problems intersect, doing some kind of reasoning over open domain text. He is the original architect of the AllenNLP toolkit, and the instigator of the NLP Highlights podcast.<br/><br/><br/>

                    <b>Title:</b> Understanding and Employing Learned Representation in Supervised, Self-supervised Learning and Decision-Making Process<br/><br/>
                    <b>Abstract:</b> How to learn good latent representations is an important topic in the modern era of machine learning. Deep models excel because from raw data they learn a good representation on which the tasks become easier. Understanding the learned representations leads to strong model interpretability and better algorithms, and using a good representation makes the decision-making process more efficient. In this talk, I will cover our recent works on understanding representation in supervised and self-supervised learning by opening the black-box of the deep network, as well as strong performance in black-box optimization, if a good task-specific representation is learned during the optimization process.<br/><br/>

                    <b>Title:</b> Controllable Text Generation Beyond Auto-regressive Models<br/><br/>
                    <b>Abstract:</b> Recent advances in large auto-regressive language models have demonstrated appealing results in generating natural languages and significantly improved the performances for applications such as machine translation and summarization. However, when the generation tasks are open-ended and the content is under-specified, existing techniques struggle to generalize to novel scenarios and generate long-term coherent and creative content. This happens because the generation models are trained to capture the surface patterns (i.e. sequences of words) following the left-to-right order, instead of capturing underlying semantics and discourse structures. In this talk, I will present our recent works on controllable text generation that go beyond the prevalent auto-regressive formulation. We explore hierarchical generation and insertion-based generation, with applications to creative story generation and image captioning.<br/><br/>

                    <b>Title:</b> Learning to Reason with Text and Tables<br/><br/>
                    <b>Abstract:</b> A key challenge for Artificial Intelligence is to design intelligent agents that can reason with heterogeneous representations. In this talk, I will describe our recent work on teaching machines to reason in semi-structured tables and unstructured text data. More specifically, I will introduce: (1) TabFact, a large benchmark dataset for table-based fact-checking; (2) HybridQA and OTT-QA, multi-hop question answering frameworks on tables and text; (3) How one can utilize TabFact to facilitate logical natural language generation with LogicNLG. I will also describe some other work at UCSB's NLP Group on learning to reason with multiple modalities.<br/><br/>

                    <b>Title:</b> Integer optimization for predictive and prescriptive analytics in high stakes domains<br/><br/>
                    <b>Abstract:</b> Data-driven predictive and prescriptive analytics tools are increasingly being used to assist decision-making in high stakes domains (e.g., to prioritize people experiencing homelessness for scarce housing resources, to identify individuals at risk of suicide, and to design public health interventions). The deployment of such algorithms in these domains that can impact people’s lives and societal outcomes creates an urgent need for algorithms that are fair and interpretable and that leverage the available data to its full extent to yield the most accurate decisions. In this presentation, we discuss our recent works that leverage tools from integer optimization and causal inference to design optimal, interpretable, and fair decision-support tools that are suitable to deploy in high stakes settings.<br/><br/>
                    <b>Bio:</b> Phebe Vayanos is an Assistant Professor of Industrial & Systems Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Southern California. She is also an Associate Director of CAIS, the Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society, an interdisciplinary research initiative between the schools of Engineering and Social Work at USC. Her research is focused on Operations Research and Artificial Intelligence and in particular on optimization and machine learning. Her work is motivated by problems that are important for social good, such as those arising in public housing allocation, public health, and biodiversity conservation. Prior to joining USC, she was lecturer in the Operations Research and Statistics Group at the MIT Sloan School of Management, and a postdoctoral research associate in the Operations Research Center at MIT. She holds a PhD degree in Operations Research and an MEng degree in Electrical & Electronic Engineering, both from Imperial College London. She served as a member of the ad hoc INFORMS AI Strategy Advisory Committee and is an elected member of the Committee on Stochastic Programming (COSP).
